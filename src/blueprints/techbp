## 1. Project Setup

- [ ] **Gather Requirements**
  - Review, clarify, and finalize the feature blueprint and user flows
  - Identify MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features for launch

- [ ] **Choose Tech Stack**
  - Select frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue)
  - Select backend framework/language (e.g., Node.js, Django)
  - Choose database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
  - Decide on file storage (for images, portfolios)
  - Select deployment/hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS, DigitalOcean)

- [ ] **Set Up Version Control**
  - Initialize Git repository
  - Set up basic README, .gitignore, and project structure

---

## 2. Design & Planning

- [ ] **Wireframe Key Pages**
  - Homepage, team profile, dashboards, search/browse, login/signup

- [ ] **Design Database Schema**
  - Users, teams, projects, portfolios, messages, reviews, etc.

- [ ] **Define API Endpoints**
  - List the required endpoints for frontend-backend communication

## 3. Core Development

- [ ] **Set Up Development Environment**
  - Install dependencies, configure linters, formatters, etc.

  - Users, teams, portfolios, projects, messages, reviews

- [ ] **Set Up Authentication**
  - User/team registration, login, logout, password reset

#### B. **Frontend Foundation**

- [ ] **Build Page Layouts**

## 4. Testing

- [ ] **Unit Testing**
  - Write tests for backend logic, database models, and API endpoints

- [ ] **Frontend Testing**
  - Test forms, flows, and UI components

- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - Ensure end-to-end flows work: registration → profile → search → message → hire

- [ ] **Manual User Testing**
  - Try all flows as both business and team users

---

## 5. Deployment

- [ ] **Set Up Hosting Environment**
  - Configure backend and frontend deployment

- [ ] **Deploy MVP Version Online**

- [ ] **Set Up Domain Name**

---

## 6. Feedback & Iteration

- [ ] **Collect Early Feedback**
  - From test users, friends, or mentors

- [ ] **Fix Bugs & Refine Flows**

- [ ] **Plan Next Features**
  - Prioritize based on feedback and business goals
